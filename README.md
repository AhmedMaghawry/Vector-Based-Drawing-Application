# Vector-Based-Drawing-Application
This porject Design an object oriented model for geometric shapes .
In order to be able to implement an efficient and object oriented drawing application. It is essential to design a model that takes these relations into consideration.
It offers a big number of features that includes but is not limited to:
Drawing, Coloring, and Resizing. They also include a number of built in, and possibly extensible set of geometric shapes, and classically, they allow the user to undo or redo any instructions so as to make the application more usable.
It has an option that allows the user to extend application features at runtime. This can be easily done by the dynamic class loading capabilities that Java offers.
Another feature to add is editing the painting, either by moving, deleting or resizing any object.
